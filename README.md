## code journal: 

This assignment was little bit issues with server error. I used Ash's example of code and try to run the server. Also, I kept looking classmate's example how they did and compare of mine and to use it. Also, how to solve it. Also, when I head issues I asked **Bradon**alot. He always tried to help me and tells me "try this code I used" Also, tells me wrong code.
